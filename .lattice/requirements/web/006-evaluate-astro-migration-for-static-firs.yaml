title: Evaluate Astro migration for static-first architecture
body: Evaluate migrating forkzero.ai from React+Vite SPA to Astro for static-first rendering with React islands. Astro provides built-in SSG, better SEO out of the box, faster page loads, and native blog support with content collections. Assess migration effort, feature parity, and whether the reader page (dynamic SPA) can work as an Astro island. Document findings and recommendation.
