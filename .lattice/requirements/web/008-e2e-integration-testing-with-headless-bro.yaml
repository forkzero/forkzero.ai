title: End-to-end integration testing with headless browser
body: Add Playwright for end-to-end testing against the built site. Tests start a local preview server (vite preview or static file server on dist/), then exercise real browser navigation. Cover critical paths - home page loads, Blog nav link navigates to /blog, blog listing shows posts, clicking a post navigates to /blog/<slug> and renders full article, back link returns to listing, reader page loads with ?url= param. Verify pre-rendered pages serve correct HTML before JS hydration (check document.title and meta tags on initial load). Run in CI with Playwright's built-in browser install. Separate make target (make e2e) and optional in make ci to avoid slowing fast feedback loop.
