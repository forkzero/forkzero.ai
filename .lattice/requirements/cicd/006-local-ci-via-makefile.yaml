title: Local CI via Makefile
body: 'A Makefile provides the same quality gates locally that CI enforces remotely. The make ci target runs: install, format check, lint, typecheck, build, and test with coverage — in that order. Individual targets (make format, make lint, make test, etc.) can be run independently. make clean removes dist/ and node_modules/. Developers run make ci before pushing to catch issues before CI.'
