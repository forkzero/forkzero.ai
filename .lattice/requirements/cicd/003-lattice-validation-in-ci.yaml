title: Lattice validation in CI
body: 'CI validates the .lattice/ directory on every push and PR. Three checks run: (1) YAML syntax validation on all .lattice/*.yaml files using yaml-lint, (2) required field check — every node must have id, title, and status fields, (3) lattice lint using the lattice CLI binary installed from the forkzero/lattice release. Additionally, smoke tests run lattice list commands to verify the lattice is loadable. These checks run as a separate parallel job so failures are clearly attributed to lattice issues, not code issues.'
