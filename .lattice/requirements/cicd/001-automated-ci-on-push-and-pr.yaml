title: Automated CI on push and pull requests
body: 'All pushes and pull requests to main trigger a CI workflow in GitHub Actions. The pipeline runs in order: (1) npm ci, (2) Prettier format check, (3) ESLint, (4) TypeScript typecheck, (5) Vite build with pre-render, (6) vitest with coverage thresholds. Any failure blocks the workflow. Each step is a separate named action for clear failure attribution.'
